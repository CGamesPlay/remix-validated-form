import { PropHeader } from "~/components/PropHeader";

<PropHeader
  variant="h1"
  prop="useIsSubmitting"
  type="() => boolean"
/>

A hook that returns whether or not the current form is being submitted.
This only works if used inside the context of a `ValidatedForm`.
It is still safe to use this hook outside of a `ValidatedForm` --
it just will always return `false`.
