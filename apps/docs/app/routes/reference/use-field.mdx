import { PropHeader } from "~/components/PropHeader";

<PropHeader
  variant="h1"
  prop="useField"
  type="(name: string, options?: UseFieldOptions) => FieldProps"
/>

Accepts the `name` of the field and returns
data about the field and helper functions for the field.
This only works if used inside the context of a `ValidatedForm`.
It is still safe to use this hook outside of a `ValidatedForm`,
but there will be no `error` or `defaultValue`
and the helpers will be no-ops.

## FieldProps

<PropHeader prop="error" type="string | undefined" />

The validation error message if there is one.

<PropHeader
  prop="getInputProps"
  type={`<T extends {}>(props?: T) => T`}
/>

A prop-getter used to get the props for the input.
This will automatically set up the validation behavior based on the [`validationBehavior`](#validationBehavior) option.

<PropHeader prop="defaultValue" type="any" />

The default value of the field, if there is one.

<PropHeader prop="clearError" type="() => void" />

Clears the error message.

<PropHeader prop="validate" type="() => void" />

Validates the form field and populates the `error` prop if there is an error.

<PropHeader prop="touched" type="boolean" />

Whether or not the field has been touched.
If you're using `getInputProps`, a field will become touched on blur.

<PropHeader
  prop="setTouched"
  type="(touched: boolean) => void"
/>

Sets the `touched` state of the field to whatever you pass in.

## UseFieldOptions

<PropHeader
  prop="validationBehavior"
  optional
  type={outdent`
  {
    initial?: "onChange" | "onBlur" | "onSubmit";
    whenTouched?: "onChange" | "onBlur" | "onSubmit";
    whenSubmitted?: "onChange" | "onBlur" | "onSubmit";
  }`}
/>

Allows you to configure when the field should validate.
The keys (`initial`, `whenTouched`, `whenSubmitted`) are states the field/form could be in,
and the values (`onChange`, `onBlur`, `onSubmit`) are when you want to validate while in that state.

**Note:** This behavior only applies when you are using `getInputProps`.
If you're managing the validation manually (using `validate`, `clearError`, `setTouched`, etc),
this will have no effect.

#### Field/form states

- `initial`
  - The field has not been touched and the form has not been submitted.
- `whenTouched`
  - The user touched the field. A field becomes touched on blur, or when you call `setTouched(true)`.
- `whenSubmitted`
  - The user attempted to submit the form.

#### When to validate

- `onChange`
  - Validates every time the `onChange` event of the input fires.
- `onBlur`
  - Validates every time the `onBlur` event of the input fires.
  - Clears the error message when the user starts typing in that field again.
- `onSubmit`
  - The field does not validate itself at all and only validates when the form is submitted.

No matter which option you choose, the form will always be validated again on submit.

#### Default configuration

By default the field will validate on blur,
then validate on every change after the field has been touched our submitted.

```
{
  initial: "onBlur",
  whenTouched: "onChange",
  whenSubmitted: "onChange",
}
```

<PropHeader
  prop="handleReceiveFocus"
  type="() => void"
  optional
/>

When the form gets submitted and the validation fails, the first invalid input will receive focus.
If you have a custom input component that needs to receive focus,
you can pass a callback to this option to control what happens when that component needs to receive focus.
If this prop is not provided, the `input` will receive focus as normal (hidden inputs are skipped).
