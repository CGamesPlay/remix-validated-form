  title: useField (Remix Validated Form)
---

import { PropHeader } from "~/components/PropHeader";

<PropHeader
  variant="h1"
  prop="useField"
  type="(name: string, options?: UseFieldOptions) => FieldProps"
/>

Accepts the `name` of the field and returns
data about the field and helper functions for the field.
This only works if used inside the context of a `ValidatedForm`.
It is still safe to use this hook outside of a `ValidatedForm`,
but there will be no `error` or `defaultValue`
and the helpers will be no-ops.

## FieldProps

<PropHeader prop="error" type="string | undefined" />

The validation error message if there is one.

<PropHeader prop="defaultValue" type="any" />

The default value of the field, if there is one.

<PropHeader prop="clearError" type="() => void" />

Clears the error message.

<PropHeader prop="validate" type="() => void" />

Validates the form field and populates the `error` prop if there is an error.

## UseFieldOptions

<PropHeader
  prop="handleReceiveFocus"
  type="() => void"
  optional
/>

When the form gets submitted and the validation fails, the first invalid input will receive focus.
If you have a custom input component that needs to receive focus,
you can pass a callback to this option to control what happens when that component needs to receive focus.
If this prop is not provided, the `input` will receive focus as normal (hidden inputs are skipped).
