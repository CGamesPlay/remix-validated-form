# ValidatedForm

## Props

<PropHeader prop="validator" type="Validator<DataType>" />

A `Validator` object that describes how to validate the form.
The generic type `DataType` is the type of the data that the form is expecting.
If you provide an `onSubmit` prop to the `ValidatedForm`,
it will be called with the form data and be correctly typed as `DataType`.

```tsx
const validator = withZod(z.object({ name: z.string() }));

<ValidatedForm validator={validator} />;
```

<PropHeader
  prop="onSubmit"
  type="(data: DataType, event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => void"
  optional
/>

A submit callback that gets called when the form is submitted.
The `data` argument is the parsed and typed form data.

<PropHeader prop="resetAfterSubmit" type="boolean" optional />

Reset the form to the default values after the form has been successfully submitted.
This is useful if you want to submit the same form multiple times,
and don't redirect in between submissions.

<PropHeader prop="subaction" type="string" optional />

Allows you to specify a "subaction" for the form.
This adds a hidden input to the form with the value of the subaction.
The purpose of this is to allow you to handle multiple forms in the same action function.

<PropHeader
  prop="fetcher"
  type="(data: DataType, event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => void"
  optional
/>

Allows you to provide a `fetcher` from remix's `useFetcher` hook.
The form will use the fetcher for loading states, action data, etc
instead of the default form action. This can be useful for when you need to
submit the form programatically but still have validation errors show up.

<PropHeader prop="defaultValues" type="Partial<DataType>" optional />

An object to be used for the default values of the form fields.

<PropHeader
  prop="formRef"
  type="React.RefObject<HTMLFormElement>"
  optional
/>

A ref to the underlying form element. This is used instead of `forwardRef`
because of the generic type of the component.
