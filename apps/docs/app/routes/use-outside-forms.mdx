# Using hooks outside forms

Most of the time, you'll be using the hooks in this library
within the context of a `ValidatedForm` component.
However, also possible use any of the hooks _outside_ a `ValidatedForm`
and have it still work.
All you have to do is put an `id` on your form and pass that `id` to the hook.

### Normal usage inside a `ValidatedForm`

```tsx
const SubmitButton = () => {
  const isSubmitting = useIsSubmitting();
  return (
    <Button disabled={isSubmitting}>
      {isSubmitting ? "Submitting..." : "Submit"}
    </Button>
  );
};

const FormComponent = () => {
  return (
    <ValidatedForm>
      <input name="name" />
      <SubmitButton />
    </ValidatedForm>
  );
};
```

### Usage outside of a `ValidatedForm`

```tsx
const FormComponent = () => {
  // The id "myForm" is passed both to the hook _and_ to the form
  const isSubmitting = useIsSubmitting("myForm");

  return (
    <ValidatedForm id="myForm">
      <input name="name" />
      <Button disabled={isSubmitting}>
        {isSubmitting ? "Submitting..." : "Submit"}
      </Button>
    </ValidatedForm>
  );
};
```
