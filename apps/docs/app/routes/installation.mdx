import { Footer } from "~/components/Footer";

# Installation

## Base package

`remix-validated-form` is the package containing the core components of the library.

```bash
npm install remix-validated-form
```

## Validation library adapter

To support particular validation libraries, you also need an adapter for that library.
There are official adapters available for `zod` and `yup`.
If you're using a different library, you can create one
(see [Validation library support](/validation-library-support)).

- @remix-validated-form/with-zod
- @remix-validated-form/with-yup

```bash
npm install @remix-validated-form/with-zod
```
