# Arrays and nested data

One thing this library makes easy for you is handling arrays and nested data in your forms.
If you have fields with paths for names,
it will be transformed into a nested data structure before it gets validated.

<CodeExample>
  <Demo />

```tsx file=~/examples/nestedData.tsx

```

</CodeExample>
